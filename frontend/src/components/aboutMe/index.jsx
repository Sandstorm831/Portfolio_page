          â€¦So It all starts with my operating system. I have decided to switch
          my OS from windows to Linux during my first semester of college, which
          marks my journey in the software engineering field. During my software
          journey, I have contributed in{" "}
          {<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/"> SageMath</a>} (Open-Source
          Mathematical Software), worked at{" "}
          {<a href="https://www.worldquant.com/">WorldQuant</a>} as a part-time
          research consultant and have also worked at Intellimation.AI as a
          Software Developer. My journey revolved around Machine learning and
          Deep learning stuff in my first couple of years of college, after
          which I switched gears and took competitive programming seriously, I
          have solved more then 1000+ problems from platforms like
          {<a href="https://codeforces.com"> CodeForces</a>},
          {<a href="https://leetcode.com"> LeetCode</a>},
          {<a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/"> IntervieBit</a>},
          {<a href="https://atcoder.jp/"> AtCoder</a>} and
          {<a href="https://cses.fi/"> CSES</a>}. You can find the solution of
          all those problems

            <a href="https://github.com/Sandstorm831/programming_palindrome">
              {" "}
              here
            </a>
          }
          . Leaving competitive programming behind I started full-stack
          developement, in which I took MERN Stack as my stack and have been
          learning my way through it till now.
